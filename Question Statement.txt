Train a logistic regression model for the attached dataset. You have to submit two files one for Sklearn and one for using the gradient decent and cost function without using sSklearn.

Split your data into 70% training and 30% testing and check your accuracy. 

Then add polynomial features of degree 2 and then again train your model and check whether the accuracy increased or decreased.
